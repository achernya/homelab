# Directly use the cilium CLI to instal cilium the first time. The
# real cilium installation will happen when argocd puts the
# customizations on using the cilium helm chart. However, argocd
# itself can't be scheduled until we have _a_ CNI running ... which is
# provided by cilium. So this is required to break the dependency
# cycle.
